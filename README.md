# React Portfolio

## Description

As a junior web developer I created an online portfolio for potential future employers showcasing my skill and projects I created. This portfolio was created using React which is the latest tool I have learned. Working on this project also helped me to deepen my understanding to React and its capabilities. Through the portfolio page I can present various application using different technologies and show my progress along my journey.
